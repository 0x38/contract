# Signable contract in a single file

- Host it on your own domain
- Can only be singed once
- Comes with "Print" and "Download as PDF" buttons

**Signable demo:** [vileworks.com/contract/demo.php](http://vileworks.com/contract/demo.php) <br>
**Generate a new contract online:** [vileworks.com/contract/generator/](http://vileworks.com/contract/generator/)

Upload the **contract.php** file to your server and send a link to your client. 
(You can rename this file, for example if there are other contracts in the same folder.)
Once they have signed, this php file will delete itself 
and leave behind an HTML version of the signed contract 
that can be printed or downloaded as a PDF.
