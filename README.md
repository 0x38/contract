# Single File PHP Contract

Upload the contract.php file to your server and send a link to your client. 
(You can rename this file, for example if there are other contracts in the same folder.)

Once they have signed, this php file will delete itself and leave behind an HTML version 
of the signed contract that can be printed or downloaded as a PDF.
