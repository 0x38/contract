# Single File PHP Contract

Signable demo: http://vileworks.com/contract/demo.php

Upload the contract.php file to your server and send a link to your client. 
(You can rename this file, for example if there are other contracts in the same folder.)

Once they have signed, this php file will delete itself 
and leave behind an HTML version of the signed contract 
that can be printed or downloaded as a PDF.
