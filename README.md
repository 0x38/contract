# Single File PHP Contract

Upload the contract.php file to your server and send a link to your client. (You can rename this php, for example if there are other contracts in that folder.)

Once they have signed, this php file will delete itself and leave behind a read-only version of the contract that can be printed or downloaded as a PDF.
